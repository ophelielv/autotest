Order of calls / stacktrace:
1. /routes/index.js
2. /services/mocha.service.js
3. /suites/test1.spec.js
4. /services/selenium.service.js which calls the following files:

## Front 
Success! Created autotestfront at C:\Projects\autotest\autotestfront
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd autotestfront
  npm start
  http://localhost:3001


## Chrome driver

Ok assuming you are using Windows please try the following steps:

    Download the latest version of ChromeDriver from here http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html

    Extract the zip and place the contents somewhere you know where it is for example "C:\Users\UserName\AppData\ChromeDriver"

    Go to your Control Panel -> System -> Edit the System Variables. Click on the "environment variables" button.

    In the system variables box there will be a variable named "Path" select it and click edit. Copy and paste the path to the containing directory of the chromedriver.exe you downloaded onto the end of the variable value and end it with a semi-colon.

    Click ok and again to close environment variables and again to close system properties.

    Close and reopen your terminal window.

    Run the command again.

I hope this helps - there is a good tutorial here https://simpleprogrammer.com/selenium-with-node-js/
